# Tetris
This project is a simple clone of the game tetris. Move a tetrimino using arrow keys / WASD, rotate using up / W, hard drop by pressing space, hold using C, and pause by pressing P. Try to beat my high score of 23,000!
# How I made it
This project was made without any frameworks, just the JavaScript canvas. This was a unique challenge as I had to manage what was drawn, when, and what to clear. I tried to optimize the game by only redrawing where a block was moved, rather than redrawing the entire game.
# Progress
This project is finished, but if you find any glitches or have suggestions, please submit them under the [issues tab](https://github.com/luketrenaman/tetris/issues).
